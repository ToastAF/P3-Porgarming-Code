# P3-Porgarming-Code


This is an attempt at creating a game resembling the popular MMO League of Legends.
All 2D sprites and 3D models, that are not Unity primitives, are made by me.

All around, I spend around 40-50 hours on this project. Maybe more.

### Description
For this project I chose to make League of Legends, but worse. The point of the game is to kill the enemies, minions and turrets, earn gold to buy items, and then destroy their base to win the game. However, in my version I have only implemented earning gold and buying items, the enemies, minions and turrets, so there is no way to win the game, technically. Yet, you can still die from the enemies, so surviving is winning.

In the current version of the game, the player can move around, shoot abilities with the Q and W keys, damaging enemies and using mana, take damage from enemies, earn gold by killing enemies, and buy items in the shop with that gold, increasing the player's stats.

The project is made in Unity 2022.3.8f1, so to run it, have this version installed and download the project. Works on Windows computer.

### The game contains:
-A player that can move around using NavMeshSurface and NavMeshAgent<br/>
-Controlled by right mouse button<br/>
-Use Q and W to cast abilities<br/>
-Different types of enemies<br/>
-A turret that shoots the player at long range<br/>
-A minion that shoots the player at short range<br/>
-An enemy, which basically acts like a target dummy<br/>
-UI<br/>
-Health and mana bars dependant on player health and mana<br/>
-A toggleable shop menu using P<br/>
-Inventory able to hold 6 items<br/>
-Stats and gold count<br/>
-Icons for the abilities, which show their range, if you hover over them<br/>
-Terrain which the player walks around<br/>
-Ground<br/>

### 3D models:
-A small red-hooded minion (made by myself)<br/>
-A turret with a big staff (made by myself)<br/>
-Unity primitives for the player, some enemies, ground, terrain, and projectiles<br/>

### Materials:
-Unity primitive materials for player, enemy, projectiles, and ground<br/>
-Particle materials using sprites made by myself for particle systems when shooting and hitting objects<br/>
